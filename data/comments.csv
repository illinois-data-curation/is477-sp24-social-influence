kyvb3x0,1c08w09,Don't forget that Disney owns Hulu so boycott them too  Edit: and ESPN
kv5x740,1bg9err,"Given how the counter-productive actions of fans in the 80s and 90s really damaged the show's reputation, both in the media and among the BBC executives who were making the decisions, we need to be really careful about knee-jerk responses to unexpected news.  The show has a huge budget, the people I consider to be the best Who writers are back, and there is a huge marketing push to get it into mainstream consciousness.    But thanks to the awkwardness of the Earth's spin, we're either going to have to stay up late, or watch it in the morning after getting up, or avoid social media until the evening, or see some spoilers before we see the show.  Disney are putting the money up, it's entirely realistic that they would call the shots on this.  As you say, it is money which is listened to.  Some of us are old enough to have to wait *years* to see our favourite shows, with spoilers published in scifi magazines by thoughtless contributors, or sometimes passed on in person by acquaintances who had seen the show in question in the US.  We are actually in a really good position now of not having to wait years for shows, which then get edited-cut to shreds because every new broadcaster which receives the tapes employs a censor who needs to justify his salary somehow.  We now all see the same thing at the same time."
kv6e8vl,1bg9err,"Just like Sesame Street needed a cofunding deal with HBO in order to survive after budget cuts at PBS, Doctor Who needed a cofunding deal with Disney in order the survive after budget cuts at the BBC.    All boycotting Disney would do is make them feel Doctor Who isn’t worth the hastle. Then they’d stop cofunding it, and we’d have another cancellation and decade+ hiatus.    If you don’t want more Doctor Who for a really, really long time, feel free to boycott them I guess.    Me? I’m just fucking happy the show’s continuing as TV and movie studios are slashing budgets and projects left and right. I’m worried as fuck for Star Trek right now."
kv5uvdu,1bg9err,"Frankly, I have no interest in this. I'll watch the show when I choose to watch it. Why should I care if I'm not watching it """"live"""" with the UK?"
kv6pibp,1bg9err,"Russell T Davies gave a talk somewhere a few years ago, the video is on YouTube talking about BBC is going to die a slow, painful death eventually so it is not out of the ordinary for him to push streaming. I also feel like it should be mentioned that Doctor Who was canceled in the 80s partially for low viewership. Let's not motivate them to repeat history."
kv5vy7c,1bg9err,"Why? What a silly thing to get so angry about. It's the way the show was going anyway, it's already marketed as streaming first and 70% of viewership is on the iplayer after broadcast anyway."
kv5ut80,1bg9err,"People jumping straight to blaming Disney for everything as if the evil evil mouse is out there just beaning poor dear Auntie Beeb over the head with a sledgehammer over everything, instead of acknowledging that the BBC may have made a few damn decisions of their own, are making me very tired."
kv6aiak,1bg9err,"Seems rather petty to me. Can't be bothered with that shit. I'll either stay up late to watch it, or I'll watch it the following day.   Really, who gives a shit?"
kv65c13,1bg9err,"I'm no fan of the decision behind the airtime and and I'm a UK fan so I'm saying this next bit as one of the ones impacted:   I would really rather American fans weren't intentionally trying to damage the show's success and a big part of its current budget by refusing to buy D+ purely because of DW getting a prime time US release and midnight UK release.  I don't like the release schedule, but what I do like is the show doing well, having a healthy audience and potentially more funding based on its success.  I know having the show and having it do well is much more important to me than not having it at all because that's somehow better than an inconvenient time."
kv5vj2p,1bg9err,I don't understand the problem? You want d+ to force Americans to wait? I literally don't get it.
kv656o6,1bg9err,"Why do you think Disney is responsible for this, or that they're doing this to give Americans a prime time?  Friday night is a death slot for TV, and Disney usually releases their own stuff between midnight and 3AM in the continental US."
kv6sf9q,1bg9err,"Or, you know. Don't. Because this is a non-story."
kv5vq0x,1bg9err,Weird take.  The BBC can air the show whenever they want.  Ban them if you have a problem.
kv63cfu,1bg9err,The entire state of Florida which makes half of its revenue from the mouse couldn’t boycott Disney effectively. Do you really think that fans of an international sci-fi show can?
kv61wtg,1bg9err,Jesus Christ please go outside and touch grass. It’s not a bad call. Most people are busy on Saturday nights in the warmer months so we can watch it early in the morning.
kv67t7g,1bg9err,"I mean, the fact that the show is no longer hostage to bbc is good, so nah, not joining this boycott."
kv6a98d,1bg9err,Just means a few more people will need to take precautions to avoid spoilers. Personally not seen an episode live since the 80s.
kv5s959,1bg9err,"Nope, that's not going to work, for obvious reasons - Disney don't air the show in the UK, they aren't the ones deciding what time the BBC air it, and for those outside the UK, the BBC broadcast is not a legitimate option.  If you actually want to make a difference, complain. [Here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact/complaints/make-a-complaint) is how you can complain to the BBC.   Select """"TV"""", """"BBC One"""", """"No"""", then on the next page give """"Doctor Who"""" as the title, leave the optional fields blank, and choose """"scheduling"""" as your category. Then fill in the remaining details as you like, being sure to give accurate contact information (especially email).  And [here](https://help.disneyplus.com) is how you can complain to Disney+, if you're so inclined, but I'd suggest that's less likely to make a difference."
kv6gkn2,1bg9err,Peak entitlement culture here...
kv6i6er,1bg9err,Midnight drops for streaming shows are pretty common tho?
kv6dwq4,1bg9err,[removed]
kv6autk,1bg9err,Oh my god what a silly thing to get upset about
kv6ochx,1bg9err,I thought Disney+ only carried Doctor Who outside the British Isles? Why/how could British fans boycott it when it's on iplayer anyway? Or is the idea the rest of the world should wait til the UK release time so you in Britain can avoid spoilers?
kv66mas,1bg9err,"We can but I’m not going to. It’s my only choice and whilst it’s clear that a lot of people DO care about this, you’re majorly overestimating the viewing power of the people here who actually would boycott. Even you. You’re going to watch it as soon as you realistically can."
kv7by2x,1bg9err,This is not going to go the way you think.
kv7ujg6,1bg9err,I will watch when I want to. But I will also respect fellow fans and not spoil things
kv8290b,1bg9err,This thread isn’t working out the way the OP thought.
kv8iu7l,1bg9err,Absolutely insane behaviour. The boycott isn't gonna be noticeable trust me
kv5ykex,1bg9err,Disney just has weird release times. In The US most of their popular shows start at 3am. A lot of people would just wake up to watch them and go back to bed.
kv775gm,1bg9err,"It's NOT THAT BIG A DEAL! The histrionics, I swear..."
kv6lfrt,1bg9err,Why do you want to deprive those of us who cannot get the BBC?
kv61iuc,1bg9err,"OMG, grow up."
kv5wi8c,1bg9err,"Feck off, Sais."
kv67ak5,1bg9err,Why would we want to do that?
kv5weba,1bg9err,[removed]
kv9endu,1bg9err,"I watch a few things that come on past midnight UK time. I tend to watch them when I get up in the morning or when I'm back from work the next day. It's really not a big deal.  Didn't even know the Doctor Who time had been set yet. I'm paying for Disney Plus for the shows on there and Doctor Who will be one of those as I want to avoid the license fee in the UK (personal bugbear with the conning gits) that you have to pay for iPlayer. I'll be watching it either when it airs or the next day.  You know what a boycott will do, if it's successful? It won't affect the show times as those will stay the same throughout the Disney deal. But if it's actually successful, it will cause Disney to pull out of the deal that's giving extra money to the show. That takes the budget (already only stretching to eight episode shows even with the influx of new money) back to the end days of Moffat and Chibnall levels. Possibly less, because the show has been boycotted by enough people to affect viewership and drive away a corporate partner. With less money the quality falls and the amount of episodes they can make falls and the whole thing spirals until the show is cancelled again. All because you don't want to stay up slightly late or wait until the next day to watch."
kvd4m1k,1bg9err,"I'm not overly bothered about it appearing on iPlayer first, but midnight is late, especially for two episodes. 10pm or 11pm would be doable, as that's the time I usually watch TV. I certainly won't watch it in the morning, and afternoon TV would be sports if anything.  So I'll probably see it 22 hours later, unless I see spoilers on social media, in which case I'll probably skip it and watch something else."
kvk3xmk,1bg9err,"As a gamer I can say that this sort of thing not only never has the desired impact, but often seems to have no effect at all. Either enough people do not participate or the story generates additional interest itself. *Hogwarts Legacy* really tanked, huh?  Not saying we should do this even were that not so, much as it seems a silly timing decision to me.  I don't really like the big budget stories, especially from Russell but understand the need for funding, and that this isn't such a bad arrangement given the apparent lack of creative meddling.  I do think it is inadvisable to chase the international money over the domestic market - that's a bit like what happened to kill the movie. Tanked in the US, well watched here."
kv8gvfh,1bg9err,"Just because of this post, I'm going to create multiple accounts, have them all subscribe to Disney+ and then use those accounts on different devices to watch Doctor Who at the same time on Friday night."
kv8u1q5,1bg9err,Man. Seriously. Go outside. Take a break. This is a nothing burger of an issue.   This is nothing new for streaming or television.  Minus that. It’s not hard to just wait a day or two to watch the episode. Whilst avoiding spoilers.
kv8iuop,1bg9err,"Considering the people in charge have a habit of axing show's once they become streaming shows lately, I'd be very careful about boycotting anything."
kv8vwiy,1bg9err,"Fans of Doctor Who, a show all about change, cry that the show is changing again.   70%+ of the shows audience in the UK last year, watched on iPlayer.   Us fans in the US had to wait 8 hours no less than 2 years ago at least to watch the show and avoid spoilers. I understand not wanting to stay up till 1am to watch a TV show, but like watch it when you get up? Days that start with Doctor Who are really fun."
kv967y9,1bg9err,And we won't.
kv9mz5j,1bg9err,"We can do that, but we won’t."
kvamz14,1bg9err,grow up
kvbgjq1,1bg9err,Genuinely don't care about release times
kv9s7bq,1bg9err,"A lot of people here are being unnecessarily nasty, but you have my support OP. I actually began the boycott because I unsubscribed from Disney+ after the Christmas episode, because I thought the 4 Specials were awful."
kv8k0tr,1bg9err,"Omg. The *years.* And if you didn’t have a video recorder and you missed it live, who knows if you’d ever see it again?"
kv5yke7,1bg9err,"Excellent comment, idk if it's a generational thing or what made me this way, but I consider it totally normal to wait a few years in between watching my favorite shows and then binge all the old and new stuff together at once to keep up. I don't mind spoilers and the little bits I get from social media don't impact my enjoyment. But I agree with everything you said."
kv5zrg6,1bg9err,Somehow the first sane take in this entire thread
kv8jd3e,1bg9err,"So much this. Every time someone complains about a show, it’s more likely to get the axe.   I was worried about Percy Jackson because so many adults were complaining about it but the kids *loved* it. Thankfully it got renewed. I’m team Don’t Rock the Boat on everything now. Gotta love what you love until it dies because studios are willing to cut anything that they see as a problem."
kvaddul,1bg9err,Equating the Disney deal to Sesame Street absolutely selling out isn’t exactly doing what you think it’s doing.
kv5ve9k,1bg9err,Then you do you. Nobody's forcing you not to watch whenever you want  But it's apparent from the last thread that a lot of people do care. I'm only talking to them
kv7db4c,1bg9err,Yeah under a long-term conservative government the bbc is going to die from death by a thousand cuts. So a move to a private company is safer because the Tories can’t cut netflix or Disney plus etc.
kv5ydcl,1bg9err,I'm starting to suspect that this shift towards being a streaming show might have been necessary to keep making the show. I think we'll eventually find out that we were much closer to total cancellation than we thought.
kv5v91x,1bg9err,I believe I saw someone mention that Disney launches new shows at midnight in general so this would indeed be related to them(assuming that information is correct)
kv7p3id,1bg9err,"Exactly. The message Disney would understand from this """"boycott"""" would be, """"We wasted our money on Doctor Who. Nobody wants to watch it,"""" not, """"We need to release the episodes at a different time."""""
kv5vn8i,1bg9err,Yes
kv64jpl,1bg9err,not the BBC's decision
kv64ftt,1bg9err,"You think I'm trying to bankrupt the whole company? The only thing that needs to be changed is moving the airtime 19 hours for a single show.  They do still want people to watch, otherwise why are they helping with the show?"
kv5sgwu,1bg9err,"Of course UK viewers will get it from BBC/iPlayer, I'm talking to US/international viewers only. Lots of US viewers also want to watch live with the UK, rather than on Friday night, 19 hours ahead of live broadcast"

kv7feau,1bg9err,Including your own.
kv5vnos,1bg9err,Ok. I'm just responding to your call for a boycott and stating that I don't support it. That's all.
kva29c1,1bg9err,-> a lot of people do care   -> 73 downvotes
kv5yrfe,1bg9err,"We already know from TomeDeaf and other leaks that the view from the trenches at BBC Studios throughout 2020/21 was that at the very least there'd be an outright hiatus until 2024/5, but quite possibly the show would just disappear and not come back. And of course, NuWho actually *was* cancelled - the show made by Bad Wolf is technically a new legal entity/IP, probably to get around licensing agreements with WB that had been signed up to S15 of NuWho."
kv5vxsr,1bg9err,"It’s launching at midnight UK time, at the same time it drops on iplayer.  This is early evening in the US."
kv5wgfg,1bg9err,The BBC has been increasingly doing the same thing itself.
kv65h4w,1bg9err,"Midnight PT, which is quite a bit later than midnight GMT."
kv5vryr,1bg9err,Why? What is their motivation? Who is going to boycott to get something they want later?
kv6l5u1,1bg9err,Source?
kv6pw7a,1bg9err,You have no evidence that it was not the BBC and Disney alone. I feel like so many people here are so quick to villainize Disney for no reason. We are on our way to having the show more accessible and popular than ever because of them. I do not understand why people are so pissy at Disney.
kv65krt,1bg9err,"It was a joke. Sorry if it didn’t read. I’m just saying Disney probably DGF and are trying to strategically capture a larger North American audience. I think it’s a dumb move because Americans don’t watch things just because they drop in prime time. They’d be just as likely to watch something day of if it dropped in the afternoon, if it’s promoted heavily. I don’t disagree with your sentiments, but I’m skepticism that a boycott by DW fans would affect their bottom line enough to have them change their marketing strategy."
kv5sxif,1bg9err,"Right, but foreigners boycotting Disney+ isn't going to influence what time the BBC airs it."
kv60gii,1bg9err,">Lots of US viewers also want to watch live with the UK, rather than on Friday night, 19 hours ahead of live broadcast  Then wait and watch it when it broadcasts in the UK, nobody is forcing you to watch it the moment it's added to Disney+. I can't believe people are complaining about having early access to their favourite shows.   Surely it's better that it's added earlier than broadcast so you can be sure to watch it as it airs (if that matters to you for some reason) than having it uploaded simultaneously with the live broadcast and potentially not being available at broadcast due to technical issues.  Besides, isn't it being added to iPlayer ahead of broadcast anyway (unless I misunderstood the situation) so most UK fans that care will probably watch it ahead of the live broadcast too."
kv5w4au,1bg9err,Watch it on iplayer if you care this much.
kv5tphd,1bg9err,[removed]
kv6pajg,1bg9err,Then wait for it to air in the uk and watch it then. Why should Disney be forced to listen to an impatient noon Brit?
kv6cgue,1bg9err,"Exactly, and ok by virtue of this some places are getting it prime time on Friday in the US, but certainly not every timezone. This seems to me to be the BBC experimenting with this kind of release for DW and not some kind of Disney mandate."
kv5yimu,1bg9err,"Lots of Americans in these threads wants to watch live with the UK, not before it broadcasts on BBC  https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1bfenrd/new_series_confirmed_to_air_on_11th_may_in_uk/  https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1bfes98/doctor_who_season_one_premieres_11th_may_2024/"

kv69zdc,1bg9err,>The point is to change the Disney air time   But you won't be able to.   The entire UK could boycott it on Disney and it wouldn't change anything

kv5wl8k,1bg9err,[removed]
kv66vzg,1bg9err,I am not going to be waiting for a time that suits you to watch my favorite tv show.
kv5z2hm,1bg9err,Not if they want to avoid spoilers on social media or participate in live discussions online
kv7zc7t,1bg9err,"If you think dvds is how anyone purchases media, I’m glad you’ve chosen to visit us, the Doctor"
kv607dz,1bg9err,"> wait until the dvds are released  you're waiting hours to days at most, not months. Episodes used to be found on Amazon immediately after broadcast. Not sure how they're going to do it this time though"
kv6834g,1bg9err,Then avoid spoilers and live discussions until you watch the show. It's really that simple.
kv65fwx,1bg9err,"I'm sorry, and I mean this in the nicest possible way, but do you know that there are people organizing boycotts for things like child slavery & the great Pacific garbage patch, and you're here putting your energy into moving a streaming release less than 24 hours? If you were a character on doctor who, I would hope you are soon to have your moment of character growth & development."
kv6cnoa,1bg9err,"You can’t just avoid social media for a few hours and participate in the conversation after you’ve seen it? How chronically online are you? This all just feels silly and pointless. Just watch the show you like when you’re able to watch it, and don’t worry about what other people are doing. I don’t understand this obsession with when other people are watching the show. Who cares!? It’s not a race."
kv69p23,1bg9err,"It's really not, because spoilers show up in feeds like Google Discover, YouTube video titles, social media, reddit front page, etc. It's not a huge deal, but """"just avoid spoilers"""" is impossible without also avoiding technology."
kv66n2s,1bg9err,"Alright, I'll get right on fixing child slavery. And after maybe 10,000 years later when that's fixed, I can finally drink tea again"

Then you'll have no problem waiting till Saturday"
kv6gab3,1bg9err,"""""How can I avoid spoilers for a few hours when I need to spend all my time on social media and googling Doctor Who?""""  This isn't an issue. There will be conversations online that you won't be a part of regardless of when the show airs, and conversations keep starting back up as people watch the episode. In my opinion, if the new schedule keeps some number of people off Twitter for a few hours, it's a positive change."
kv67lhe,1bg9err,"*cue the doctor whisking you off to 10,000 years in the future when there hasn't been child slavery for 9980 years ever since you did something about it way back when, starting today.*"
kv67que,1bg9err,The point is that your individual action in opposition of Doctor Who release times is going to be just as effective as your individual action in opposition of slavery. So why not spend that time and effort opposing something that actually matters?
kv7x275,1bg9err,">Of course I *can*, but that's not how I want to enjoy the show.

kv6r9h4,1bg9err,"I definitely get spoilers for media I'm not googling, even if I totally avoid social media/youtube/reddit/whatever.

khmev1a,195dvjg,"I'm not going to """"boycott"""" Disney over some vague political reason that essentially boils down to """"I can't believe they showed a gay character on screen.""""  If I stop spending money on Disney, it'll be because their streaming service becomes too expensive or they start nickel-and-diming for content, or because I am sick of live action remakes.  If I'm gonna be mad at the studio, it's going to because they are forgetting their roots as an *animation* studio that once upon a time crafted timeless orchestral scores and works of art -- as opposed to bland 3D, AI dialogue, and pop culture tunes.  When they put out an amazing movie, I'll pay for it.  When they put out pandering low effort garbage, I won't."
khmeh3l,195dvjg,this is chapter 10 in the book “how to ruin my kids childhood and make them have no friends”.
khns8qk,195dvjg,"No, I haven’t boycotted Disney, but I would not go to Florida to Disney World, or anywhere, because my son is trans and the laws passed there would target him. Disney parks are also sooo expensive."
khmtzgm,195dvjg,"Can't say I'm boycotting it, just not going to the theme parks because of the outrageous expense.  There are other theme parks across the US that provide better value, and our kids never gave much of a dick about anything Disney, including animation.  I've got Disney+ but, honestly, the adults watch it ten times more than the kids ever have.  My 2yo son and 6yo grandson watch YouTube videos all the time, and my 1yo granddaughter likes Telletubbies (yeah, retro), Cocomelon, and that's about it... She'd rather be crawling around, playing.  While I may not partake of some things for political/humanitarian reasons, the kids don't have a clue what that is about, so no use in not letting them watch something that makes them happy.  When they get old enough, they can choose their own path, as I never tried to make """"mini-me""""s out of my kids.  Always have them the path to question things and make their own choices... As contrary to being a Boomer as that may fucking be.    My parents didn't do it to me, supporting my decisions, so that's what I've carried on, and that's why we're a very close family... Respect.  A kiss shouldn't give it to a parent, if the parent isn't willing to give it to their children (even if their children are grown, as 4 out of 5 of mine are)."
khmhtew,195dvjg,"I don't boycott Disney I'm just not a fan of it, haven't been for years  If the kids want to watch Disney they can want a Disney toy yeah sure whatever.  I don't go out of my way to avoid it but I don't go out of my way to buy into it.  I'm in the UK so it is quite easy"
khmg6qs,195dvjg,It's pretty easy not to take a vacation somewhere. Disneyland has gotten ridiculously expensive.  It's much harder to block all media from a certain company.
khmu40q,195dvjg,I don't have a problem with Disney but I have stopped my sons watching YouTube. They may not relate to discussions about the popular YouTubers their friends may watch but they just talk about other things instead. There's so much choice available that children who don't watch Disney will still be able to watch plenty of other things.
khpscuf,195dvjg,"No, because I'm not in a cult 😁😁😁"
khotx0c,195dvjg,Your two cents won’t make a dent in their bottom line. And I support the 🏳️‍🌈community so this is a no brainer for me.
khoyrlv,195dvjg,I wouldn’t. I don’t care too much about politics
khpeym1,195dvjg,You can't possibly boycott them anyways thats why they are pressure targets if you have alternatives use them if you dont thats okay you can read about yhe boycott from bds's own website for accurate information and not from random people on the internet
khpvkee,195dvjg,"I think the only reason why I dislike Disney is mostly because of how child stars are treated, but it's more their parents exploiting them, too. Still though."
khv9jwq,195dvjg,I didn’t boycott Disney and still don’t. My 2.5 yo loves Mickey and goofy
khmmz5g,195dvjg,I dont boycott disney but I fucking hate disneyworld on a practical level and think disney+ is way overpriced so I don't pay for it. Not everything is about your kids and they wont be harmed if they dont have disney in their lives lol my kid doesnt even really like the disney movies we have
khmg30n,195dvjg,"We don't boycott Disney, but I do avoid other things (like cocomelon) that my kids do want. Ultimately it's up to me as their mom to decide what I think is best for them, regardless of what they want. Sure I'll negotiate and discuss a lot of things and I'll explain my rationale for anything, but some things aren't up for discussion because kids aren't always going to understand the entire situation."
khndm5g,195dvjg,"no. my daughter loves bluey, and we don't have cable so we stream it on disney+. she likes the princess movies, the buddies movies, she even likes the pirates of the Caribbean movies. we sit and watch a movie once a week or whenever she's fighting sleep at 3am. disney+ is just easy to go to and know we can find a suitable movie to put on. she has a merida doll because she thinks merida looks like her. i'm not gonna tell her no to that. i'll say no to cocomelon all day long, but not disney. of course we won't be going to disney world because it's fuckass expensive for no reason."
khnjfdh,195dvjg,"I’ve learned as a parent that kids have their own likes and personalities. When my daughter was little there were some things I swore I’d never buy into. Monster High was an easy example. Nothing political, I just did not like the franchise. Well guess who would up with a huge monster high playhouse and about a million dolls.  As much as I hated the franchise my daughter loved it, it was top on a Santa wishlist, all her friends played with it. So that’s what you do as a parent, you let go of your own ego and prioritize your kid."
khmfj4e,195dvjg,"That depends. Is the “political reasons” the fact that they support Israel, or is it for other reasons"
khmbt5y,195dvjg,"I'm happy to sail the high seas for them, but my money is going elsewhere."
khmjquw,195dvjg,"I'm boycotting Disney world this year. I just can't justify the expense when kiddo is too young to recognize characters, ride the rides and would require renting a stroller or wagon. When she's old enough to really enjoy it, I'll take her."
khmmzv6,195dvjg,I am not boycotting anything. It is not my job to fix the world
kxrupdi,195dvjg,Yep. I boycott disney. It's pandering trash. My kid will never see disney anything post 2000 until they are old enough that I can't stop them. Wouldn't ever step foot in Disneyland either. I think they should pay reparations to all star wars fans as well for ruining the franchise. Kylo Ren is a bitch. Disney is garbage. I hope they go bankrupt.
khn299c,195dvjg,"Depending on why you want to boycot them, maybe just pirate the movies or something."
khnmf9s,195dvjg,"Lots of nice things on Disney+ for my kids and for me there's Futurama. I'm not boycotting lol. I'll be honest though, I'm so not up to date with these things, I don't even know what you're talking about."
khmll4c,195dvjg,"Yea. It’s awful. Horrible labor practices, gender modeling, and so much more."
khmgm73,195dvjg,We just avoid all franchises. Anything that provides an addictive product (like kids tv) paired with merchandise is toxic as far as I am concerned. Disney may be the biggest (and most annoying) perpetrator but we are opting out of the whole culture.
khnyzf4,195dvjg,"I'm pretty moderate politically, maybe leaning more conservative in some areas. I do not boycott disney. Especially the parks. Everything for the most part is pretty neutral at the parks and that is an experience I love and I want my kids to enjoy. I understand people who want to boycott though, it's a crap load of money and if they are strong in their beliefs they don't want their money going to things they don't agree with."
khmi8az,195dvjg,Lol
khnzmo0,195dvjg,"I recently had to drop Disney plus because if it's outrageous price increasing over the past year. I explained to my kid that not only are they asking way too much a month, but they are also commiting atrocities over seas, she understood, but I made a compromise. We agreed to PURCHASE her favorite shows and movies so that she can continue to enjoy things like """"Bluey"""" and """"The Nightmare Before Christmas"""" and honestly it's WAY more cost effective considering that is only 2 months of streaming. I personally just don't understand how they can be so greedy all the while sending money off to a country currently under investigation for genocide, it just doesn't make any sense."
kho7206,195dvjg,"My kids will see disney classics and all those cartoons that made my childhood more magical :) however i am not giving money to disneyland! And they aint missing out on anything. I never been to one and am perfectly fine ;)   As for the new movies, nah. Imma not make them watch those that are clearly just political brainwashing, there is no point in them seeing this crap. If they produce new movies with actual quality, absolutely i have nothing against it. But just because it is disney and popular, doesn't mean every of their products is good for my child.   I don't need corrupt disney to degenerate my kids, but i wont took away all the childhood magic from them just because of my opinion about the company :)"
khos284,195dvjg,"If it's your money, you're allowed to boycott whatever you want. I don't go to hobby lobby and I wouldn't take my kids there to shop if they asked. I don't support hobby lobby because they have a clause on their health insurance to not cover birth control for their employees. So, in a way, I guess I would if I had a reason to boycott Disney."
khqbmmv,195dvjg,I’m boycotting the parka because I can’t afford to even buy sandwich. I’m not watching the life action’s because I prefer the cartoons. My kid and nieces/nephews watched a few life actions and said the graphics were shitty
khtr8ia,195dvjg,[removed]
khwc8cj,195dvjg,It's really easy staying informed these days I was able to find those while cooking dinner. You don't have any excuse to not be informed.
kibjnpp,195dvjg,"Since when is it a parent's responsibility to give a child what they WANT? Rather than what a child needs? If you bring your kid to the grocery store and they want all the candy in the entire store are you going to buy them every single candy? Are you going to let your kid drive a car before they're legally allowed to? Or drink and do drugs because they want to? You don't have to be a parent to be sensible in these things it's pretty obvious if you're a good person to know what's right and wrong. Disney used to be made for innocent children that wanted to actually learn something. Once you take the political stuff out of it then we'll let them watch it. Don't act as if it's okay to have political things in children's shows when they have no need for it because they're not adults. There's a reason why children can't vote until they're 18. There's a reason why children can't drink until they're 21. There's a reason why children are not supposed to have sex or watch p*** until they're 18. It's our responsibility as adults to keep children as innocent as possible and teach them the important ways of life. Let children explore and find out if they're gay on their own nobody needs to tell them, nobody needs to show them, people were plenty gay 40 years ago and even a thousand years ago without some TV show to show them. Do we have to hand feed them every possible outcome of what they can be when they get older? Do you think Neil Armstrong's parents said """" hey son btw you can be an astronaut and go to the moon"""" when he was 10. Hell no. People get to where they are and create a legacy for themselves without a kids show or some book telling them they can."
khpryod,195dvjg,Yup! Fuckin Disney Plus went from 6.99 to 11.40 in less than 12 months. The bastards!!
khmetdc,195dvjg,I would have totally been mad at my parents if they deprived me of Disney movies and shows.
khmlno0,195dvjg,There is a lot more to life than Disney. My kid’s been just fine without it.
khpc27l,195dvjg,"Ditto. My daughter is gay, and we talked about going to Disney World until Florida went batshit. Fuck Florida. They get none of our money."
khnw617,195dvjg,I’m out of the loop. What’s wrong with cocomelon?
khn4hp6,195dvjg,[deleted]
khmhinu,195dvjg,"I honestly stopped caring about the political side of things long ago. I focus on the entertainment aspect of Disney movies, shows, and games."
khmie1i,195dvjg,Boooo
khmjzqg,195dvjg,"That’s fine. At least you’re not depriving her of Disney movies and shows. I think some super-political parents do that, which I really don’t understand."
khn3cax,195dvjg,I had a neighbor who sold pirated movies when I was a kid. He ended up in jail years later…though it was for other reasons.
khne21m,195dvjg,I’m curious what that leaves as an option. What media are your kids allowed to opt into?
khtrxaw,195dvjg,[removed]
khts2q8,195dvjg,[removed]
khv716l,195dvjg,"I’m not. But some people, even parents, take their political and social beliefs way too far sometimes."
khp1a04,195dvjg,"I feel you but they do have a point here. Reality is, most parents let their kids interact with Disney stuff, and so that’s what a lot of kids talk about and connect with each other on. Relating about common interests is how people make friends.    Of course, on its own not knowing about Disney-related things won’t ostracize a kid. There’s still plenty of stuff to talk about. But if there are other factors affecting their ability to connect with peers and form friendships, it could definitely play a part in things.   Ftr I’m not trying to tell you what to do with your kid. Your kid is doing good, so keep doing what you’re doing! Just offering another perspective."
khvz1rb,195dvjg,I think California Adventure has done LGBTQ events. I live in Southern California and have only been to Disneyland and California Adventure.
khoclge,195dvjg,"I don't know why you're being downvoted for asking a question, but I don't like how my kids behave with coocmelon around. They have more tantrums, whine for the TV more, play with their toys less when the TV is on, and on top of all of that I don't like the animation. They're creepy looking."
khndo0e,195dvjg,Nothing? My kids know about different family situations and we attend Pride every year. We don't boycott anything for lgtbq inclusions.
khml44j,195dvjg,??? It’s a genuine question
khmk9p1,195dvjg,"Well technically I'm depriving her of *all* movies for the next few days but that's because she's gotten really addicted to the TV. But no, I wouldn't deprive her of stuff like that for political reasons."
khprr9a,195dvjg,"When I say """"we are opting out"""" I mean my partner and I limit what we pay for, which is basically the only thing we can control. Sometimes I screen things that come into the house in other ways, e.g. gifts, but that may have to stop as they get older.  As far as what is left, it makes me sad that that's a question at all. The kids have about 100 books that are not part of franchises. if you have to do screentime, theres tons of screentime that's not franchised as well."
khujupc,195dvjg,Contributing to the genocide of the Palestinian people.
khz8f2g,195dvjg,"By political i mean alligned with current agenda that our politics implement. Not necessrily debates about political  sides themself :) Disney is trying to be """"woke"""" now soooooo freaking bad that they have lost all the quality they had established with countless classics. Cuz today throwing in diversity purely for the sake of it is more important than quality.   Idk if character is black, lgbtq+, muslim etc. heck my fave disney characters are lion king simba and his daughter, pocahontas and mulan. Neither of them is my race, some not even my species 😅 i am not lesbian but i love Korasami (lesbian couple Kora and Asami in legend of Kora, not disney movie tho). It is interesting when characters have mental and physical dissabilities because it enriches the stories by showing us something new. I love learning about all kind's of religions too. So i don't mind any of it being present, in fact i think we need more movies that show these in meaningful way. For example yes, we don't have many black princesses, i think black people deserve proper representation and original new movies with black characters, not some cheap recoloring of established white character ;)   When diversity is forced for the sake of it, not really being meaningful to the story and NEITHER being just random characteristic, it ruins the movie. I want my kid to treat everyone equally. Minority or not, it doesn't matter, nobody is more important. It is nothing to make huge deal out of and to force everywhere and focus on it. Whether i am straight, lesbian, bi, whatever, that is just one thing about me. It is unrealistis and unsane to revolve my whole existance around it and demand everyone else to so the same. Also if my race (or my dissability for example) is not important, meaningful to the story, there is NO reason to focus the story on it.  For example you can make movie focusing on showing how blindness affect people and have meaningfully blind person, or you can have movie unrelated to blindness with coincidentally blind character where blindness is just one trait about them, that you are not focusing on to the point of overtaking story itself.  Disney (like many others) nowadays is trying too hard to forcefully add things just for sake of adding it. Also i don't need my kids to learn delusions for the same of somebody else not liking facts. Sure old disney movies are not perfect either (especially the ones including POC, like Aladdin, have quite some racism hidden in it. And disney is full of sexism) and it will already take effort for me to correct those and ensure my kid does not internalize it, i don't need my job even harder by some foolish wokeness/politic corectness 🙄 especially if it is so bad that there is not even a good story to make it worth watching (old ones at least had that). Not to mention everything is getting """"dumb-ed down"""". I don't need cartoons to be killing my kid's braincells, society will already do enough of that it seems 🥲 especially this ipad generation."
khvzus6,195dvjg,"That monarchies worked for some countries, I guess? Most Disney movies take places in fictional, medieval times eras, so they usually show monarchies."
khpdmn4,195dvjg,"There's also a difference between: we don't watch/play with Disney stuff in the house and you aren't allowed to watch any Disney. Like, I can understand not being a Disney house (for a whole host of reasons, honestly), but still letting your kid watch stuff at a friend's house or whatever. You can still get the bonding and shared experience, but you don't have to personally support the company. So there's some middle ground options, too."
khqqu66,195dvjg,"There is a cocomelon song about kids putting toys in the potty. It overflows and dad tells them not to do that. """"Don't put toys in the potty"""" was now my son's favorite anthem. Guess how quickly we had to learn how to fix toilets? We actually had to remove all 3 of them over the course of one weekend. I hate cocomelon."
khpvsbn,195dvjg,I've seen how it affects younger kids. It's crazy.
khmkf79,195dvjg,"Even my parents wouldn’t let my sister and I watch tv for a while if we were watching too much, so what you’re doing is totally normal, non-biased parenting."
khr3lxt,195dvjg,"Okay, it makes you sad. I’m curious why you’re not answering the question though? Like, a handful of examples of stuff you’re okay with?"
khuu3c0,195dvjg,[removed]
khrgdts,195dvjg,Agreed! And I think “you can watch it if it’s on at a friends but at home you have Dreamworks” is a reasonable place to put the line in the sand.
khq72sy,195dvjg,we just don't have it here and I'm sure AF not going to Disney. But she's seen that stuff at friend's houses. She does not feel deprived.
khtp0lm,195dvjg,Do you want me to sit down in front of my kids' bookshelves and write down a list of books? It's such a bizarre question.  Stillwater is an example of a tv show for kids that's not franchised. Planet Earth. Ms. Rachel. We don't watch tv much so I can't think of many.
khvzonf,195dvjg,"Actually, they donated money to a Red Cross organization that’s helping civilians, especially young children, who have been caught in the crossfire of the war."
khv7ivb,195dvjg,By contributing money to Israel's military forces. All of this is very easy to look up if you haven't seen anything about it since it started in October.
khscw5z,195dvjg,Yeah exactly. And even houses that love Disney shouldn't feel obligated to bankrupt themselves by doing a Disney trip unless they can really afford it. The pressure is intense and unnecessary.
khtu8hq,195dvjg,"I just for asked “a few examples” to understand better, I dunno why that’s a big chore that requires you to sit down and make a list. You surely know things your kids have and watch? Your reaction to someone merely asking more info on your comment is more bizarre, frankly.   Thanks for the info, sorry it caused a problem."
